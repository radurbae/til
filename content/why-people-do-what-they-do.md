### Have you ever wondered why people do what they do? Why do people behave like this and that? What drives them to do what they do?

I will outline five historically dominant theories to answer those questions.

**Religion**

This theory views human behavior as an internal war between "good" and "evil". Also, religion serves as a roadmap and a source of strength to guide humanity toward the path of goodness and civilization.

**Biology**

This theory views human behavior as driven by the urge to pass their genes to the next generation. I'll also highlight a fundamental conflict in strategies between males and females.

- Male: Because their biological contribution was minimal. Their strategy is often to reproduce with as many partners as possible.

- Female: different from male, their contribution was much bigger. To have a child, they must bear pregnancy for nine months, and childbirth is practically traumatic and painful. Also, raising a child takes not less than two decades, so they have to be more cautious and selective about their partners to ensure they have a high return after those biological investments.

**Race and Culture**

This theory states that the world is a competition for dominance between different groups. Various groups believe that each race has specific characteristics, and the world has proven it through history; nations were competing for power and dominance, so it became a massive war between nations.

**Economics**

It's a simple perspective that says humans are driven primarily by self-interest and money. Like Adam Smith said,

> **"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."**

The goal of this theory is to accumulate as much wealth as possible.

**Liberalism**

It states that humanity is on a one-way street toward getting better. It treats history not as a series of random events, but as a steady climb upward. The theory assumes that because humans are rational beings, we will naturally figure out better ways to live over time. We learn from our mistakes, invent better technology, and create fairer governments.
